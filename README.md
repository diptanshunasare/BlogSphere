# BlogSphere
I have developed a fully functional blogging web application that enables users to freely express their thoughts by writing, posting, sharing, updating, and deleting their blogs. In addition to these core features, users can search for specific blogs or sort them by date, viewing the latest or oldest posts. The platform has two distinct modules: User and Admin. Users can manage their own blogs and explore the entire blog collection. On the other hand, the Admin has overarching control, allowing them to monitor all blogs and users. Admins can block users who post inappropriate or misleading content and can delete specific blogs when necessary to maintain the platformâ€™s integrity.
